The "IoT Intelligent Gas Leakage Detector" uses an MQ gas sensor and Arduino to detect gas leaks, triggering local alerts (buzzer/LED) and sending remote notifications via IoT platforms like Blynk. It logs real-time data, enabling remote monitoring and safety actions, enhancing protection in homes or industrial settings.
